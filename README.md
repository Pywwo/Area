#Â AREA
AREA is a web platform that lets you link up different services to each other thanks to Actions and REActions.<br>
On this platform, the combination of an Action and a REAction is referred to as an Applet.<br>
You could, for example, create an Applet that links a service like Github to a service like Outlook.<br>
The Action would be something like a new push on a given Github repository and this Action would trigger the REAction. <br>
In this case scenario, the REAction could be something like sending a mail containing informations about the commit.
